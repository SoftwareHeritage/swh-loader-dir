loader/dir.yml:

    storage:
      cls: remote
      args:
        url: http://localhost:5002/

    send_contents: True
    send_directories: True
    send_revisions: True
    send_releases: True
    send_occurrences: True
    # nb of max contents to send for storage
    content_packet_size: 100
    # 100 Mib of content data
    content_packet_block_size_bytes: 104857600
    # limit for swh content storage for one blob (beyond that limit, the
    # content's data is not sent for storage)
    content_packet_size_bytes: 1073741824
    directory_packet_size: 250
    revision_packet_size: 100
    release_packet_size: 100
    occurrence_packet_size: 100

Present in possible locations:
- ~/.config/swh/loader/dir.ini
- ~/.swh/loader/dir.ini
- /etc/softwareheritage/loader/dir.ini


#### Toplevel

Load directory directly from code or toplevel:

    from swh.loader.dir.tasks import LoadDirRepository

    dir_path = '/path/to/directory

    # Fill in those
    origin = {}
    release = None
    revision = {}
    occurrence = {}

    LoaderDir().load(dir_path, origin, revision, release, [occurrence])


#### Celery

Load directory using celery.

Providing you have a properly configured celery up and running

worker.ini needs to be updated with the following keys:

    task_modules = swh.loader.dir.tasks
    task_queues = swh_loader_dir

cf. https://forge.softwareheritage.org/diffusion/DCORE/browse/master/README.md
for more details

You can send the following message to the task queue:

    from swh.loader.dir.tasks import LoadDirRepository

    # Fill in those
    origin = {}
    release = None
    revision = {}
    occurrence = {}

    # Send message to the task queue
    LoaderDir().load(('/path/to/dir,
                     origin,
                     revision,
                     release,
                     [occurrence]))
